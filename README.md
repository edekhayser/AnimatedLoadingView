#AnimatedLoadingView

AnimatedLoadingView is an aesthetically pleasing loading screen for operations with an unknown duration. This view has a clear background, and can be placed over another view with the view behind showing through. If you want the background dimmed, change the background colour of AnimatedLoadingView to a black/grey with transparency.

Idea by [Douglas Bumby](https://www.github.com/istx25). 
Modelled after Monument Valley.
