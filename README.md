# LoadingView

LoadingView is an aesthetically pleasing loading screen for operations with an unknown duration. This view has a clear background, and can be placed over another view with the view behind showing through. If you want the background dimmed, change the background color of LoadingView to a black/gray with transparency.

Idea by Douglas Bumby. Modelled after Monument Valley.
